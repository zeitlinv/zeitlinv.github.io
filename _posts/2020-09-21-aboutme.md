## Computer Science Experience

I have taken CS1, CS2, and a big data and machine learning course. The language I have the most experience in would probably be Java, since that is what we primarily worked with in CS2. I am at a similar level in Python, aside from not knowing how to use classes and couple other things we did in Java. Over the summer, I learned how to do some basic exploratory data analysis in Python using packages such as pandas and numpy, as well as how to make tables and graphs. I also used classification and regression models to make predictions based on finance data sets. In math, I am currently up to precalculus, and I have not yet taken a statistics class.

## Hobby

One of my favorite activities is snowboarding, even though I am not experienced in it. I learned how to snowboard a few years ago, and ever since, I have wanted to go every winter. Here is a picture of one of my favorite snowboarders, **Shaun White**:

I can only do a few tricks, such as the 180, but someday I would like to try snowboarding on a halfpipe:

Some of my favorite competitions are the X games and Winter Olympics, and these are the events I most enjoy watching:

1. Slopestyle
2. Snowboard cross
3. Big air

You can find out more about these events [here](https://www.olympic.org/international-ski-federation#:~:text=There%20are%2011%20snowboard%20events,men's%20and%20women's%20big%20air.)

## Looking forward to this year

I am looking forward to most of my classes this year, especially CS and physics. I am excited to do much more with Python this year, since I have really enjoyed working with it so far. I hope to expand on some of what I learned in the data course over the summer. Also, I am looking forward to doing projects with statstics, which is a relatively new but intriguing topic to me.
